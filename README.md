# Video Library Module

This module is intended to help create and manage a list of **Vimeo** and/or **YouTube** video URLs, and add a searchable dropdown to descriptive fields in the **Online Designer**. This module can also be setup to use another instance of the module as the "library" allowing for one instance of the module to power multiple projects.


## Project Level Module Configuration

### Use alternate video library source
This is where you can provide an alternate URL to use another instance of this module as the source for the current instance. 
> *To find source URL for this field please see the **Video Library Management** section.*


### Hide video player when [YouTube/Vimeo] videos are stopped
Activating either of these will cover the video embed with a black box any time the video is stopped to prevent users from seeing unwanted "related videos."


## Video Library Management
While viewing a project which has this module activated you will see a link titled **Video Library Configuration** under the "External Modules" header on the left hand navigation. This is where you will manage your video library.


### Video Library URL
On the Video Library Configuration page under the Video Library URL you will find the source URL that you would use when setting up another instance of this module to use this instance as the source. 
> *See **Project Level Module Configuration** for more info on where to use this URL.*

### Videos
The **Videos** section of the Video Library Configuration page is where you **Add**, **Edit**, and **Delete** videos from your Library. Once you enter a **Vimeo** or **YouTube** URL into the *URL* field and leave the field the Module will attempt to automatically populate the *Title* field for you. After that are the *Description* and *Tag* fields. All of these fields are searchable when using the library to add videos to descriptive fields on your project.
> *Once you are finished managing your videos don't forget to click **Save** at the bottom of the page!*
